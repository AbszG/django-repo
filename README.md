# django-repo
Frequent django implementations based on django defaults.

this repo is made for testing purposes, please look for more advanced and secure methods in django docs and the internet. 

Please read the comments.

these implementations work around database values so please make sure to makemigrations and migrate after implementing.

note that you have to set the Urls yourself.
